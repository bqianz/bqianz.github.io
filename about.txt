In my undergraduate years, I did the math-version of Co-op - a research project in my department. 

i was low in the priority of who to give these funds to among the candidates, with the strong reocmmendation of one of my profs i did get the opporutnity to work on a reserach project. and in th end the results recevied a prize and turned into a paper

why am i telling this story? Chances are hard to come by, I like to believe I do well when given the chance. I have confidence in innovative problem-solving and working in teams.

I like watching asmr dessert-making videos late at night.
